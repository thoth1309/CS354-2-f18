OVERVIEW
********************************************************************************
Language Assignment 1: Scheme is a simple program designed to take an atom, or a
list, and replicate all of the elements a user-specified number of times.

COMPILING AND USING
********************************************************************************
To run this code, simply type the file name (super-duper.scm) into the bash
command line. The program does require additinal input to produce output. As it
stands it is simply a function waiting for arguments to be provided either by a
call from within the source file (e.g. the test code), or by an associated file
from which the super-duper function is visible.

TESTING
********************************************************************************
All tests conducted for LA1 are contained in a block comment within the source
code.
