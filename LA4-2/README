OVERVIEW
********************************************************************************
The program parserecords, and the program parserecords01, are AWK scripts
which take in a file name from the command line, and then find that file to
parse out relevant date. The input files must be csv (comma separated value)
files, and should contain real estate records from Ada County, ID, circa
<https://adacounty.id.gov/Development-Services/Building-Division/>, where
records of building permits are maintained. Either program will parse through
the csv file searching for single-family dwellings. When it finds a record of
a building permit for a single-family dwelling (not including additions or
modifications to said dwellings), it will glean the date of the permit, the
name of the subdivision in which the permit was issued, the lot and block of
the construction, and the value of the dwelling. Once the information has been
parsed out of the file, it will be returned in the form of an .html file,
which can be read in most browsers.

COMPILING AND USING
********************************************************************************
This program (script) is composed of two separate and distinct files. Both
opperate completely independently, and should be run alone, depending upon the
desired output. Both files are should be marked as executable. If they are
not, simply enter the following into the command line:
```
$ chmod +x parserecords
```
or
```
$ chmod +x parserecords01
```
This should make the file executable and enable it to run more easily from the
command line.
 
If a new .html file output is desired, the user should enter the following
command into the command line:
```
$ parserecords <filename.csv>
```
where filename.csv is the name of the comma separated value input file.
The output file will be named parseData.html.

If the user should desire that the output be printed directly to the consol,
or desires to reroute the output to a file of her/his own naming convention,
enter the following into the command line instead:
```
$ parserecords01 <filename.csv>
```	
where filename.csv is the name of the comma separated value input file.
The output from this version of the program will be returned directly to the
screen through stdout.

The returned output from these scripts can be opened and viewed in most
internet browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and others.

TESTING
********************************************************************************
Testing for this program was conducted by running the program on the provided
.csv file to determine what output was being produced. Once the desired output
was found, the program was modified to output the data in html format so that
the produced table could be viewed in a web browser.

Further tests were performed by taking other data from the ada county website
listed in the OVERVIEW section. The data from all files was compared visually
to the output produced to determine whether or not the correct results were
being output.
