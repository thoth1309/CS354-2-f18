* Description
**********
These programs are designed to perform two different, but related, functions.
The first, meetone.pl is designed to take in a user specified time frame and
return the names of all individuals who are available to meet during that time.
The second file, meet.pl is designed to take the names of several individuals,
and print the times which each of them is available to meet during. This program
includes the following files:

```
uniq.pl
data.pl
meetone.pl
meet.pl
```
of which meet.pl and meetone.pl both contain executable 'main' functions.


* Running and Using
**********
In order to run this program, you must first ensure that the files meetone.pl
and meet.pl are executable. If this needs to be done, or if you are unsure,
enter the following commands into the bash console:
```
$ chmod +X meetone.pl
$ chmod +X meet.pl
```
Both files are designed with a #! comment line at the beginning of the file
which directs bash in the proper compilation and execution of the files.
After ensuring that each of the files is marked as executable, simply select
your desired file and enter one of the following commands into the bash console:
```
$ meetone.pl
```
or:
```
$ meet.pl
```
This will cause the selected program to run on the command line.

* Testing
**********
Testing for these programs was performed largely on the command line using
commands listed as testx: where x is the number of the test performed. These
tests are inactive, but remain in the source file. All of the functions
currently return the correct values. The meetone() test is the only test which
is not currently producing correct values, resulting in instantiation errors
when it should be returning the yes, though it does correctly return no when the
individual's available meeting times do not correspond with the input time.
